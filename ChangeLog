TODO
* remove deprecated function:
  - libmsiecf_file_get_item
  - libmsiecf_file_get_recovered_item
* pymsiecf
  - add support for leak: Last cache synchronization date and time
* hash calculation: check what the preceding bytes could be
* use libfdata ?
* msiecfexport:
  - URL what about unknown timestamps
* code clean up
  - add initialize functions
  - rename item values to item value
  - change read values to match libwrc

Tests:
* add cache directory tests

File format
* implement MSIE 3 cache file formats ?

  - flag if items are hashed

Performance improvement
* pre allocate item/directory array entries

Tools
* msiecfinfo
  - print cache directories
* msiecfexport
  - export to TSV ?
  - flexible output formatting
  - flexible date/time string formatting

In progress:
* record scan
  - flag entries in hash table as hashed
